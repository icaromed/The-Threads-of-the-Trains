# The-Threads-of-the-Trains
A GUI app with two thread-animated trains that follow their rail's path and (kinda) avoid collisions, wich one with it's individual speed controller.

# That was the second project of the Discipline Concurrent Programming, so I've developed some skills:

Dealing with threads and learnign how to animate using them.
Dealing with multithread (concurrency) problems.

# How to play:
Go to root directory and type the following command lines:
$ javac Principal.java
$ java Principal
